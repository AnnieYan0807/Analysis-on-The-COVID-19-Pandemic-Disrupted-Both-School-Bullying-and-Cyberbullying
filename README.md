# The COVID-19 Pandemic's Impact on Bullying Search Intensity with respect to Asian Population

This repository contains code and data to produce a paper which is a reproduction of some aspects of Bacher-Hicks, Goodman, Green and Holt (2022)'s paper: The COVID-19 Pandemic Disrupted Both School Bullying and Cyberbullying. Additionally, there is also code to perform a replication of Figure 1 in that paper.

The Inputs folder contains all the raw data downloaded from the paper's replication package found at: <https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/156901/version/V1/view>

The Outputs folder contains two subfolders:

-   The Paper folder contains the quarto document and references used to generate the overall paper

-   The data folder contains all the cleaned csv files used to generate graphs in the quarto document.

The Scripts folder contains 4 scripts:

-   The simulate_data script creates a sample dataset with a reduced number of states.

-   The download_data script has documentation on how to download the raw data.

-   The data_cleaning script cleans the data by selecting the states used in the analysis, and renaming columns and values for readability.

-   The test_data script tests the validity of the cleaned datasets.

The replication on the SSRP can be found at : <https://doi.org/10.48152/ssrp-54f4-p919>
