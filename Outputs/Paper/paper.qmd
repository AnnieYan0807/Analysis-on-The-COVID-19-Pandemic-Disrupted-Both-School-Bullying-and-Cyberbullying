# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. For instance, @sec-data and @sec-first-point. 

talking points
1) why asian population? because anti-asian violence in the usa grew. we want to see if anti-asian violence was also reflected in school and cyber bullying (introduction).
2) our replicated graphs show that bullying numbers dropped during covid, 
3) But there wasnt a significant correlation between asian population of states and school bullying numbers
4) do a comparison of top 10 asian vs bottom 10 asian population states to see if asian population actually matters in school bullying
5) lack of correlation testing, this is only reported bullying, not reflected of everyone getting bullied. only those that search
6) next steps: try asian population in certain schools instead of states? a hard comparison between asian bullying and violence?
7) bias of only reported data (sampling) with people that only searches for bullying. ethics of using peoples search data. unreliability of measurement. not every1 uses google for searches or bullying help. google's algorithm will shift towards anti-bullying stuff for people that search for it.

```{r}
#### use this code to graph the 3 bully datas

#state_bully_data |> ggplot(aes(x = date, y = sum)) + 
 # geom_col() +
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,hjust=1)) +
  #labs(
  #  x = "School Year Date Intervals",
  #  y = "Sum of Searches by Investigated States"
  #)

```



# Data {#sec-data}

Our data is of penguins (@fig-bills).

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk more about it.

Also bills and their average (@fig-billssssss). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-billssssss
#| fig-cap: More bills of penguins
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk way more about it. 



# Model

$$
Pr(\theta | y) = \frac{Pr(y | \theta) Pr(\theta)}{Pr(y)}
$$ {#eq-bayes}

@eq-bayes seems useful, eh?

Here's a dumb example of how to use some references: In paper we run our analysis in `R` [@citeR]. We also use the `tidyverse` which was written by @thereferencecanbewhatever If we were interested in baseball data then @citeLahman could be useful. 

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.


# Results

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
