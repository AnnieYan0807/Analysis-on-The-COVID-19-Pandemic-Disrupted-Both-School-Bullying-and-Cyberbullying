Our data is of penguins (@fig-bills).

Talk more about it.

Also bills and their average (@fig-billssssss). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work.)


Talk way more about it.

  Pr(\theta | y) = \frac{Pr(y | \theta) Pr(\theta)}{Pr(y)}

    @eq-bayes seems useful, eh?
      
      Here's a dumb example of how to use some references: In paper we run our analysis in `R` [@citeR]. We also use the `tidyverse` which was written by @thereferencecanbewhatever If we were interested in baseball data then @citeLahman could be useful. 

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.
